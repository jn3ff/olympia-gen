## Zeus's powers ##

Zeus, the God of the Sky, is the king of the gods and the Ruler of Mount Olympus. He controls lightning, wind (think about it; he controls *air*). 

## Zeus exposition ##

As the king of the gods, Zeus is concerned with justice, but his Pride is immense, as one would expect. The question one must ask is, why doesn't his eldest sister, Hestia, rule? Or the more structured Demeter? His tenuous grasp, as the one who "freed the gods from Kronos" (which really came down to the actions of his mother, Rhea) in a court of extremely powerful peers, sometimes gets the best of his pride. He can resort to extreme measures to maintain control, and should be depicted as a shrewd and cunning individual. He is the god of the sky after all - there is not necessarily honor in his position. He is not a stupid leader who maintains control in the power structure via might; because in that he is matched, or in tradition; because these gods are greedy, want control, and have millenia of time to pass as if it's nothing. Zeus is extremely powerful, but he maintains his rule by any means necessary.

## Character trait "expected" of the child of Zeus ##

Brashness, arrogance, the occasional air-bender monk type (META NOTE: acceptance/violation of parents' nature is part of the core narrative tension in this game). Pride especially will be tested in children of Zeus.
