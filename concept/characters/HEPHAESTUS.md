## Hephaestus's powers ##

Hephaestus is the god of useful fire - the forge, machinery, automation. He is a builder of the highest order, who can manipulate metals like they are nothing and still manages to pretenaturally beat the machine in everything. 

## Hephaestus exposition ##

Why does Hephaestus build and build? What caused him to become excellent in all craft? Look no further than his mother, Hera. His fall from Olympus also left him crippled permanently - think of it, a God crippled in all of his immortality. He has buried all of his bitterness in his work. 

The ultimate "in the arena" engineer - problems of physics and logic captivate him as he suppresses all emotion, all ambition, all aliveness to the pursuit of the next construction. With how far humanity has come, he could be the greatest of all...

His creations can do *anything*, but his motivations are alien. He builds and builds with no concept of a larger goal or vision. He can make anything to order; it will be as good as the order specifies. This is not to say he is mindless; his work is quality and he demonstrates high sophisitication in his implementations, but he simply continues to build, as much as he can.

## Character trait "expected" of the child of Hephaestus ##

Humility, sloughing off due recognition onto others. Intellect and craftsmanship; problem solving. The rare oppositional child is effectively a primitivist - "I can make such tools and innovate such improvements, but I do not progress to the next tier of machinery" - opposing boundless progress.
