## Poseidon's powers ##

Poseidon, the God of the Sea, commands the oceans, storms, and earthquakes. He is ultimately about pressure - between chunks of earth, the crushing weight of the depths, the charge in the skies. He does not *splash*, he *crushes* and *drowns*

## Poseidon exposition ##

Poseidon perhaps has the claim of might more than any other god. The Sea claims more lives every year than anything else. He is of pressurized everything. The sea does not feel content, it is *euphoric.* The sea does not mourn quietly, it *rages* and *wrecks*. Calmness only occurs in sleep. Beach bum he is not; nor foolish; nor fickle. Poseidon has a wisdom that the other gods fail to capture; he *is* immortality in a way they are not. The sea is the source of all life.

He controls all that is destructive. Even Zeus and Hades have their domains (air and earth) infringed upon when he is in a rage. The Storm does not check boundaries or respect domain, it captures and transforms whatever it can expand into.
