## Ares's powers ##

Ares, the God of War, wields weaponry with expertise and possesses a superlative tactical mind and a brutalists' sense of justice. He does violence better than anyone else - he can bleed enemies, besiege them, starve them out, or beat them to death.

## Ares exposition ##

Ares is concerned not only with bloodshed, but conflict resolution. He is not only the god of all that is profane and vicious in human nature; he is the god of what happens at the bottom of "we simply can't get along." The terminal path of contention. 

He can leave foes bleeding desperately in the dirt with a quick strike, or he can wage a military campaign lasting months. His way is waging war to decide a victor, of exerting will via force. He has a perverse sense of justice which is not entirely unfair. He is a brutalist with an intellect, and loves war as the deciding force in human affairs.

## Character trait "expected" of the child of Ares ##

Violence, resorting to force especially, lack of diplomacy. Tactical excellence. The rare oppositional child is the peaceful Cold war-esque utilitarian. Preserve life as much as possible, to be as efficient in war as possible.
