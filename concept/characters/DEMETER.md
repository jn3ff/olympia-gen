## Demeter's powers ##

Demeter is the goddess of the weather. Growth, harvest, decay, neglect. Renewal and rejection. She can make the grasses and birds and rivers sing with life, or she can level the land into frozen tundra. Often her freezing wrath is focused on for her offensive powers, but environment control is the true name of her game.

## Demeter exposition ##

What does it mean to be the goddess of the weather? To control the cycles that underwrite the tales of mortals. In a well-mooded season, children do not starve or die to exposure; they grow healthy and strong; villages flourish. When she enters a rage, she bears no quarter. Be it freeze or drought or deluge, if you require Mother Earth to survive, Demeter can ensure that need goes unfulfilled.

This is Demeter's truth: she gives life, and she can take it away simply by *stopping*.

Demeter is often depicted as a loving, giving grandmother - this is not the true nature of the seasons. Her love is real, as steady as the seasons that always come around again, but it is abstract, vague, untargeted. In the short term it can be conditional and transactional. She nurtures like a gardener - which means she also prunes, weeds, and culls what doesn't grow right. What she tends, she expects to flourish according to her design. Disappoint her and you don't get rage; you get removed from her attention entirely. You stop being watered.

Her discipline is immense. The daily toil harvest requires runs through her blood. The seasons work tirelessly, cycling through all that is necessary for life on Earth. She is perhaps the most strategic of the Olympians, besides Athena, but Demeter does not suffer from the self-referential Hubris of Wisdom. 

## Character trait "expected" of the child of Demeter ##

Children of Demeter are expected to be temperamental but diligent & solid; loyal; focused on growth. Her shadow is often ignored in her children, but it is there. A child of Demeter is expected to provide, and dampen their controlling rage. The rare oppositional child will learn harmony, balance, Yin and Yang, and allow that sense to permeate their being.
